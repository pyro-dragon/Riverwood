    "1 So, did you hear about the orcs?"
    "2 No!"
    "3 What is there to know about them? There are plenty around."
    "1 Well yeah, but there has been a new tribe moving about on the North border. Near the wild country."
    "1 The river traders have said that they have seen them moving about with markings no one has seen before."
    "3 They are orcs, so what? They move about, whats the fuss?"
    "1 Shut up, ok? They have been saying that there have been no sightings of the other orcs."
    "1 These new guys have more or less taken over the old tribes."
    "2 They must be pretty tough to have taken on them all. Some of the Northern tribes were really nasty."
    "3 I still think there is nothing to worry about"
