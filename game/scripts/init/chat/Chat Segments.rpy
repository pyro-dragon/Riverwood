    participants["skeptic"].c "What the hell are you even going to try and change? How much do you thin the world is going to listen to a bunch of gnolls in the rural backwater?"
    participants["bragger"].c "We did it once before. We had a whole army and we did things. We changed the fate of the world and helped build the empire."
    participants["enthusiastic"].c "Yes! The old Thousand Tails regiment. I remember hearing about them. Thats how our clan got started in the firs place!"
    participants["skeptic"].c "Whoa, slow down. Ok, first that was many generations ago, that was when Temesh was about our age. Secondly, that didn't go well for the Thousand Tails. Our clan exists BECAUSE things went so badly."
